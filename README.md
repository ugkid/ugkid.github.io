## Michael Bahari's Portfolio Website
### Purpose
The purpose of this website was to create a portfolio for my web development work. I wanted to apply a personal brand identity that represented myself. This website was designed and developed in a way that I could manage and reiterate for at least a few years.
### Features
The website features a single vertical page and a navigation button. It is divided into 4 sections: Home, About, Projects and Contact. 
I chose to use a single page so that all the content could be read sequentially from top to bottom. 
The function of the navigation button is to toggle a menu between being collapsed behind the button or displayed/overlayed on the screen. Its aim is to provide direct navigational access to the sections of the page.
