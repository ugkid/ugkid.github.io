                         For our first assignment we were tasked to create a Ruby terminal application (app) in pairs. My partner Ben and I decided to make a program that would recommend a song based on your mood or an occasion.

                    <div class="project_description">
                        We looked at Spotify for our case study and observed how although there were numerous playlists to browse through, it took too many steps to discover a song that we enjoyed. We wondered if there was a way to shorten and simplify these steps. Our mission statement: “Finding a song that fits your mood or occasion takes effort. Imagine if Ben & Mike chose the music for you. With Ben & Mike’s Song Suggestor, you can listen to curated tunes in just a few clicks.”<br><br>After brainstorming possible categories, we narrowed our choices and grouped them into moods and occasions.
